The Violin Doodler is a web application that allows beginning violinists to become familiar with the layout of the violin fingerboard and the different finger patterns for a few of the keys that most early repertoire is composed in.  Students can "play" the notes by clicking and holding the mouse on the various notes.  It is possible to hide strings and change the finger patterns.  Teachers can input melodies for students to use by following the formatting instruction in the melody input window.  Melodies are listed in the Melody table by student/composer and key and can be played back or deleted.  Tempo can be selected under Preferences.

If the strings are all hidden before playback of a melody, all the notes involved in the melody will become visible by the end of playback.  The student can then try to play the melody using the mouse on the notes that have been exposed.  This is useful for training the ear/finger connection.
